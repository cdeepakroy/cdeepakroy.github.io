					  <p align="justify">Cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide and imaging, both at the 
					  microscopic and macroscopic scales, continues to serve as an invaluable tool in all facets of cancer research 
					  including diagnosis, clinical treatment and drug discovery. Microscopic imaging systems, in particular, have been 
					  very useful in gaining a deeper understanding of cancer cell biology thereby facilitating the design and discovery 
					  of better anti-cancer drugs. However, the bulk of cancer biology has been conducted using in vitro and ex vivo 
					  methods, neither of which provide an accurate representation of the complex in vivo processes. To better understand 
					  the origin and progression of cancer and its response to chemotherapeutic drugs, we need to image cancerous tissue 
					  in live animals at a microscopic resolution, a technique popularly known as intravital microscopy. However, 
					  intravital images present a whole new challenge for computational image analysis including low foreground-background 
					  contrast, weak edge information between adjacent objects, high morphological complexity, and poor depth resolution. 
					  Today’s best practice in intravital imaging is anecdotal observations of select image events. This, however, is 
					  insufficient to draw reliable inferences about the mechanisms of chemotherapeutic drug action. We have begun to tackle these image analytical challenges in a project aiming at the quantification of drug action at the single 
					  cell level in human tumor models cultured in living mice imaged intravitally in 3D using laser scanning fluorescence 
					  microscopy.</p> 
					  
					  <p align="justify">
					  To this end, we have developed a computational framework for the automated quantification and monitoring of 
					  cell cycle state distribution at multiple time points before and after treatment with cancer drugs. This framework is
					  the key facilitator for data analysis in all experimental work performed in this work by (i) largely automating the 
					  analysis of the generated microscopy data thereby enabling studies at a much larger scale, and (ii) ensuring reproducibility
					  and cross-experiment consistency of analysis unattainable by manual quantification. From a theoretical point of view,  we 
					  have developed algorithms for robust segmentation of hundreds of cells embedded in the highly cluttered tumor environment 
					  followed by their association to specific states of the cell cycle. Next, we will develop statistical methods to test 
					  biological hypotheses regarding the dynamics and spatial patterning of drug responses.</p>
