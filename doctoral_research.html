						<p align="justify">Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death both in United States and all around 
						the globe. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's 2007 disease statistics reported that (in 2004) 
						872,000 deaths or 36% of all the deaths in United States were due to cardiovascular disease.</p>
						
						<p align="justify">One of the primary causes of CVD is coronary artery atherosclerosis, also popularly known as coronary 
						artery disease (CAD), a condition that refers to a narrowing and hardening of the coronary arteries 
						that supply blood to the heart. This occurs due to atherosclerosis, a disease in which scattered 
						lesions called atherosclerotic plaques (a mixture of fatty substances, cholestrol, cellular wastes, 
						calcium, and the blood clotting material called fibrin) build up on the inner walls of the coronary 
						arteries. Such a condition progressively obstructs the flow of blood through the coronary arteries and 
						when it worsens may eventually lead to a heart attack.</p> 					
						
						<p align="justify">Recent studies have established that the presence of calcified  
						coronary plaques as detected from non-contrast computed tomography (CT) data has a significant predictive 
						value for CAD in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. To that end, several risk scores have been 
						developed to quantify the amount of coronary artery calcium (CAC) based on the data collected by CT. 
						However, inspite of the vast amount of CAD-related information available from CT, only a small fraction 
						of it is being used in existing risk scoring strategies. Additionally, most of these scores were devised 
						based on small or diseased populations without rigorous statistical validation. This can be attributed to 
						the lack of robust image analysis methods for the automated extraction of CAD-related information from 
						non-contrast CT imagery. This is precisely the issue that we are trying to address in our ongoing 
						research.</p> 
						
						<p align="justify">The overall goal of our research is to develop the fundamental set of computational tools that will 
						pave the way for the automated extraction of a variety of CAD-related information from non-contrast 
						CT data.</p>

							<b>Abstract:</b><br/><br/>	
			
							Accurate quantification of coronary artery calcium (CAC) provides an opportunity to assess the extent of atherosclerosis disease. 
							Coronary calcification burden has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular risk. Currently, an observer has to 
							identify the coronary calcifications among a set of candidate regions, obtained by thresholding and connected component
							labeling, by clicking on them. To relieve the observer of such a labor-intensive task, an automated tool is needed that 
							can detect and quantify the coronary calcifications. However, the diverse and heterogeneous nature of the candidate regions 
							poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate a supervised classification-based approach to distinguish the 
							coronary calcifications from all the candidate regions and propose a two-stage, hierarchical classifier for automated 
							coronary calcium detection. At each stage, we learn an ensemble of classifiers where each classifier is a cost-sensitive 
							learner trained on a distinct asymmetrically sampled data subset. We compute the relative location of the calcifications 
							with respect to a heartcentered coordinate system, and also use the neighboring regions of the calcifications to better 
							characterize their properties for discrimination. Our method detected coronary calcifications with an accuracy, sensitivity 
							and specificity of 98.27, 92.07 and 98.62%, respectively, for a testing dataset of non-contrast computed tomography scans from 
							105 subjects.

							<b>Abstract:</b><br/><br/>	
			
							Poor contrast of non-contrast CT scans acquired for calcium scoring makes an accurate segmentation of the coronary arteries an 
							extremely difficult or impossible problem. However, a solution to this problem is very essential for associating the coronary lesions 
							to their location in the coronary artery tree which in turn is of importance for CAD risk prediction. In this work, we present a learning-based 
							method for the estimation of coronary artery zones in non-contrast CT data. We introduce a novel heart-centered coordinate system (HCCS) which 
							is based on anatomical landmarks. The HCCS is used to align non-contrast CT heart volumes for the purpose of developing a supervised 
							classification scheme which discriminates between coronary artery zones and their surrounding tissue. The proposed method has been deployed 
							to 30 non-contrast CT  data sets with very encouraging results.

							Image segmentation is, in general, an ill-posed problem
							and additional constraints need to be imposed in order
							to achieve the desired result. Particularly in the field of
							medical image segmentation, a significant amount of prior
							knowledge is available that can be used to constrain the solution
							space of the segmentation problem. However, most
							of this prior knowledge is, in general, vague or imprecise
							in nature, which makes it very difficult to model. This is the
							problem that is addressed here. Specifically, in this
							work, we present Fuzzy-Cuts, a novel, knowledge-driven,
							graph-based method for medical image segmentation. We
							cast the problem of image segmentation as the Maximum
							A Posteriori (MAP) estimation of a Markov Random Field
							(MRF) which, in essence, is equivalent to the minimization
							of the corresponding Gibbs energy function. Considering
							the inherent imprecision that is common in the a priori
							description of objects in medical images, we propose a
							fuzzy theoretic model to incorporate knowledge-driven constraints
							into the MAP-MRF formulation. In particular, we
							focus on prior information about the object's location, appearance
							and spatial connectivity to a known seed region
							inside the object. To that end, we introduce fuzzy connectivity
							and fuzzy location priors that are used in combination
							to define the first-order clique potential of the Gibbs energy
							function. In our experiments, we demonstrate the application
							of the proposed method to the challenging problem of
							heart segmentation in non-contrast computed tomography
							(CT) data.

							and a generalized template-based star-shape constraint that are encoded into the first- and second-order clique potentials of the Gibbs

							Image segmentation is, in general, an ill-posed problem and additional constraints need to be imposed in order 
							to achieve the desired segmentation result. While segmenting organs in medical images, which is the topic of 
							this paper, a significant amount of prior knowledge about the shape, appearance, and location of the organs is 
							available that can be used to constrain the solution space of the segmentation problem. Among the various types 
							of prior information, the incorporation of prior information about shape, in particular, is very challenging. 
							In this work, we present an explicit shape-constrained MAP-MRF-based contour evolution method for the 
							segmentation of organs in 2D medical images. Specifically, we represent the segmentation contour explicitly as 
							a chain of control points. We then cast the segmentation problem as a contour evolution problem, wherein the 
							evolution of the contour is performed by iteratively solving a MAP-MRF labeling problem. The evolution of the 
							contour is governed by three types of prior information, namely: (i) appearance prior, (ii) boundary-edgeness 
							prior, and (iii) shape prior, each of which are incorporated as clique potentials into the MAP-MRF problem. 
							We use the master-slave dual decomposition framework to solve the MAP-MRF labeling problem in each iteration. 
							In our experiments, we demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of heart 
							segmentation in non-contrast computed tomography data.
