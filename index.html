					I'm currently working as a Senior Applied Data Scientist in the Bing Multimedia Team of the AI Research Group at Microsoft where in I am working on using my data mining, machine learning, deep learning, and NLP skills to improve multimedia search experience in Bing.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Prior to joining Microsoft, I worked as a Principal, Staff, and Senior R&D Engineer in the Medical Computing Team of Kitware where in I was involved in leading and contributing to the development of computer vision and machine learning algorithms to solve a wide spectrum of problems in medicine and biology.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Prior to joining Kitware, I did my Postdoctoral training in the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School. My post-doctoral research was in the areas of bio image analysis and machine learning, specifically involving the development of a computational framework for quantifying the effects of cancer drugs at a cellular level in live mice using 3D Intravital fluorescence microscopy data at a large-scale.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					Prior to joining Harvard, I did a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from University of Houston. My doctoral research was in the areas of medical image analysis and machine learning, specifically involving the development of computational methods for the detection and localization of coronary artery calcium in non-contrast CT data. My M.Sc. research was on the topic of computer-aided breast reconstructive surgery.
				</p>
				
				<p align="justify">
					My research interests include computer vision, image analysis, machine learning, pattern recognition, and natural language processing. My past research has resulted in numerous publications some of which are in premier journals/conferences such as Nature Methods, CVPR and MICCAI. Also, in recognition of my dissertation work, I received the â€œBest Ph.D. Award" from the Department of Computer science at University of Houston.
