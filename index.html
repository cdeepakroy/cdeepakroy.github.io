					I am currently working as an R&D Engineer in the medical computing team of <a href="http://www.kitware.com" target="new">Kitware</a> 
					prior to which i did my Postdoctoral Training in <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/" target="new">Harvard Medical School</a> under the 
					supervision of Prof. Gaudenz Danuser. Prior to joining Harvard University, I did a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science 
					from <a href="http://www.uh.edu" target=_blank>University of Houston</a> under the supervision of 
					<a href="http://www.vcl.uh.edu" target=_blank>Prof. Ioannis A. Kakadiaris</a>. Prior to joining University of Houston, 
					I did a Bachelors in Computer Science and Information Technology from <a href="http://www.jntu.ac.in" target=_blank>Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University</a>, Hyderabad, India.						
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					My research interests include the areas of computer vision, image analysis, machine learning and pattern recognition. My career research goal is to enable the computers to automatically understand and extract the desired information from images and video sequences.  Finding a solution to this problem is one of the major challenges faced in a wide variety of real-world applications such as video surveillance, biometrics, industrial inspection, optical character recognition, entertainment and medical image analysis. Even though the nature of the images that need to be analyzed and the type of information that needs to be extracted from them differs from application to application, the mathematical techniques used to solve the associated problems are often inter-related and quite similar in nature. The development and advancement of these techniques is precisely the task I would like to undertake in my career as a researcher.
