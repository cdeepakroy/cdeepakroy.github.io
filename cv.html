								Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death, both in United States and all around the globe. One of the primary 
								causes of CVD is coronary artery atherosclerosis, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent studies have shown that the presence 
								of calcified coronary plaques, as detected from non-contrast computed tomography (CT) data has a significant predictive value for CAD. 
								Consequently, several CAD risk scores have been developed based on the data collected by CT. However, in spite of a vast amount of 
								CAD-related information available from CT, only a small fraction of it is being used in the existing risk scores. This is due to the lack 
								of robust image analysis methods for the automated extraction of CAD-related information from non-contrast CT data. The long term goal 
								of our research, to which this dissertation contributes, is to develop a set of computational methods for the automated extraction of 
								CAD biomarkers from non-contrast CT data.							
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The specific objectives of this dissertation are: (i) To develop a general knowledge-based method for the segmentation of organs in 
								medical images with particular emphasis on the incorporation of knowledge-driven constraints into the segmentation problem, and to 
								apply this method to the problem of heart segmentation in non-contrast CT data; (ii) To develop a method for the delineation of the 
								inner thoracic region in non-contrast CT data; and (iii) To develop a method for the estimation of coronary artery zones in non-contrast 
								CT data.
							</p>

							<p>
								The main contributions of this dissertation are: (i) development of a general knowledge-driven Markov Random Field model for image 
								segmentation that uses prior information about appearance, location and shape to collectively constrain the solution space of the 
								segmentation problem; (ii) development of a graph-based method for the delineation of the inner thoracic region in non-contrast CT 
								data; and (iii) development of a learning-based method for the estimation of coronary artery zones in non-contrast CT data. The 
								accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by an extensive set of experimental results.

								With the exception of skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis
								among women worldwide. Post-mastectomy breast reconstruction is the third most frequently
								performed reconstructive procedures. The continuous creation and adoption of
								new surgical techniques and devices have made it possible for the surgeons to reconstruct
								the breast in many different ways, thus making the decision-making job of the surgeon
								much more difficult. Current trial and error methods may lead to an unsatisfactory surgical
								outcome. Hence, there is an urgent need for a system that can pre-operatively simulate
								the surgical options, visualize potential outcomes of the surgery, and, consequently, help
								the surgeon and the patient in the process of surgical planning and decision making.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								In this thesis, we present a set of computational tools for breast segmentation and breast
								shape modeling. More specifically: 1) we propose a new algorithm for automatic segmentation
								of the 3D data of a breast from a 3D scan of the patient's torso; and 2) we present
								a second generation deformable model for compact representation of the breast shape as
								estimated from 3D triangular mesh data of the patient's breast. These techniques can serve
								as the foundation of a number of applications in pre-operative planning for breast reconstruction
								and for breast plastic surgery in general.
